# Scenario
Real-time automated price generation moves into focus for online retailers. Every day, category management faces the challenge of adapting thousands of products to changing market factors. This happens completely automatically when using an intelligent pricing tool. Prices reflect customer appreciation and lead to increased sales. The topic of this yearâ€™s DATA MINING CUP is to come up with a sales forecast for a mail-order pharmacy that dynamically adapts its prices. 

# About the task
The central topic of this year's task at the DATA-MINING-CUP was the development of a model  that predicts the revenue of a mail-order pharmacy as accurately as possible. Historical anonymised transaction data of a real mail-order pharmacy were provided. The special feature: Product prices were dynamically generated automatically.

The DATA MINING CUP 2017 started April 5, 2017. The teams submitted their solution by May 17, 2017. The top ten solutions were presented at the prudsys personalization summit in Berlin on June 27. The winners were also announced in Berlin.
